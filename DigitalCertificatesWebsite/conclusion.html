				<h1>Conclusion</h1>
				
				<p>
					After this research I realise why major websites need Digital Certificates not only to make sure that they keep their customers data private but also to make sure that they keep their own data private .  Even though I saw Digital Certificate in my internet browser on a daily occurrence, I never really understood how it got there. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					It seems that in distributing Digital Certificates that they is a lot of trust required. Such as trusting in the Certificate Authority that they are completely genuine, trusting in the client and trusting in the entity that is applying for the Digital Certificate. If a fake was to get a Digital Certificate, it might take only a short time period for their Digital Certificate being revoked but in that time it could cause significant damage.
