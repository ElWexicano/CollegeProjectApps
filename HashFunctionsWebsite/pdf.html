				<h1>PDF</h1>
				
				<p>
					In this section I will be seeing how the three hash functions perform when generating a hash function for two PDF files. The files that were used had an overall size of 27.1mb and below are those files.
				</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li><a href="files/PDF/jQuery in Action.pdf">jQuery in Action</a></li>
					<li><a href="files/PDF/Software Engineering 9th Edition.pdf">Software Engineering 9th Edition</a></li>
				</ul>
				
				<h2>MD-5</h2>
				
				<p>
					Firstly I was going to get the MD-5 hash values for both books and this can be accomplished by running the following command. <i>fsum -md5 *.pdf> MD5Hashes</i> and it instantly produced a 128 bit hash value for each of the books which can be seen below. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<b>6e7abe112a72b0f2ed3ca8e9733b1801</b> *jQuery in Action.pdf<br>
					<b>ca148588f264be83bee5df58f9bb10e6</b> *Software Engineering 9th Edition.pdf
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Next I wanted to verify the integrity of the hash value and to prove that it should still work as a long as the files or hash values had not changed. The screenshot below shows the command that was used and the result which was as expected.
				</p>

				<h2>SHA-1</h2>
				
				<p>
					Next I was going to get the SHA-1 hash values for both books and this can be accomplished by running the following command. <i>fsum â€“sha1 *.pdf> SHA1Hashes</i> and it instantly produced a 160 bit hash value for each of the books which can be seen below.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<b>c846224851259074bbd1105abca434c58a3bad87</b> ?SHA1*jQuery in Action.pdf<br>
					<b>ad0f6839974539b141e05021a1378091fdcbcccf</b> ?SHA1*Software Engineering 9th Edition
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Next I wanted to verify the integrity of the hash value and to prove that it should still work as a long as the files or hash values had not changed. The screenshot below shows the command that was used and the result which was as expected.
				</p>
				
				<img src="img/PDF/verifySHA1.png" title="Verifying SHA1" alt="Verifying SHA1"/>
				
				<h2>Adler-32</h2>
				
				<p>
					Finally I was to get the Adler-32 hash values for both books and this can be accomplished by running the following command. fsum -adler *.pdf> Adler32Hashes and it instantly produced a hash value for each of the books which can be seen below.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<b>a92fcf96</b> ?ADLER32*jQuery in Action.pdf<br>
					<b>f20f7bba</b> ?ADLER32*Software Engineering 9th Edition.pdf
				</p>
				
				<p>
					This time to prove that by changing either one of the hash values or content in the books would result in verification failing so I changed the hash value for the first book. The screenshot below shows the command that I ran and the results which show that the first book failed the test because the hash value did match the one that is created from the hash function.
