					For this research there are several exercises that I had to complete. I will explain the different exercises and how they were carried out , also the findings that came from conducting these exercises. But firstly let's find about Steganography.

				<h1>About Steganography</h1>
				
				<p>
					Steganography is the science of hiding a message so that only the sender and receiver of the message know or suspect that it is actually a message. It has been used since the time of the Ancient Greeks and that is where its name originated from. Two Greek words steganos and graphei which means concealed writing. It is completely different to cryptography where the message is encrypted and may draw suspicion. Instead the message is concealed to hide its existence and thus draw no suspicion while reducing the chance of it being detected. It is common that both Cryptography and Steganography be used together to significantly improve protecting information.
				</p>
					There are a number of methods used in Stenography to hide a message, which include the following:

					<ul>
						<li>Writing messages in invisible ink to conceal information.</li>
						<li>Concealing information using character arrangement in a message.</li>
						<li>Using microdots to conceal information.</li>
						<li>Using paintings or drawings to conceal information.</li>
					</ul>

				<p>
						People have been using Steganography throughout history to hide their message such as in World War II when countries used it to keep the enemy from reading important messages. The following message was sent by a German Spy during World War II. For every stenographic method being discovered a new method was developed. Some were developed by putting a new twist on old methods. But with the arrival of computers more methods have been developed such as manipulating pixels to conceal information.
				</p>
			
				<p>
						This ancient art is still being used today and an example of this was in June 2010 when 10 spies were suspected of using steganography to conceal data that was being sent from the United States to Russia.Â
