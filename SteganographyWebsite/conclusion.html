				<h1>Conclusion</h1>
				
				<p>
					I do believe that Steganography has some extremely useful methods for security but by itself it is not a good solution to
					message security. It seems that when Steganography is used with Cryptography that it provides an excellent means of keeping a message safe. 
					But from the results it seems that it is only useful when dealing with small files of under 200 KB. Maybe this is more of an issue
					with the Hide in Picture software.??
				</p>
				<p>
					It also seems best to use 24 bit BMP over 8 bit BMP and GIF as the resulting image does not deteriate or change size.
					I would argue that the issue with the compression might cause a problem when sending and receiving message but 
					with todays internet capabilities I would not consider this an issue. It could possibly be an issue with a company that is
					sending an extremelly large number of these files.
