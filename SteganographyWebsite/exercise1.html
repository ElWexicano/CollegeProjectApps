				<h1>Exercise One</h1>
				
				<p>
					The first exercise was to perform a simple paper exercise to see how the Stenographic method of character arrangement works. For this I was to find the hidden message in the following message:
				</p>
				
				<h3>
					<i>“Apparently neutral's protest is thoroughly discounted and ignored. Isman hard hit. 
					Blockade issue affects pretext for embargo on by products, ejecting suets and vegetable oils.”</i>
				</h3>
				
				<p>
					Now on first look, the above seems like a normal message but if we take the second letter of each word and write them down then we will have the following:
				</p>
				
				<h3>
					Pershing sails from NY June 1.
				</h3>
				
				<p>
					There have been many alternatives to the above method such as misspelling to mark different words in the message, changes to spacing to mark words, different font types on words to indicate their importance and templates can be used to read a hidden message in a message.
				</p>
					
				<p>
					Thinking that Steganography only applies to written or visual information would be wrong! Since World War II audio and visual messages have been used to hide messages. A form of steganography in its simplest was to shave the head of a messenger and then put the message on the messengers head with ink and then wait till their hair grows back. The message will stay undetected till the messengers head is shaven again.
